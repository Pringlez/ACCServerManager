# ACCServerManager

**Note:**: Work in progress, don't expect this to develop quickly :)

The application will allow you to manage and run multiple ACC game servers at once. Built using springboot, react and docker, the idea is create a system that requires minimal setup on a host machine.

Currently targeting both Windows & Linux support.

I'm mainly using this a learning opportunity for some of these technologies.

## Setup

## Configuration

## Docker

## Development
To contribute to the project you need to setup a basic development environment. You'll need the following:

 * Java 8+ (JDK, IDE)
 * Maven (Build & Compile)
 * React Tools

Use whatever development tools you feel comfortable to use, for example I normally use VS Code & Intellij for most of my work.

## ToDo Features
Docker: Development of docker integration to spin up new containers using spring.
React: Get started on frontend development
